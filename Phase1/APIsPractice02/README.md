# APIs and Python

#### Key Takeaways

* HTTP GET requests will respond with an object that contains a status code AND content
* The content you are interested in will be best accessed using the `.json()`	method of the object.
* You can also send data to a HTTP endpoint with a POST request
* JSON files are nested data structures similar to nested dictionaries and lists
* Be careful about API rate limits when making requests
